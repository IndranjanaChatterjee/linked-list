# Linked List Programs in C

This repository contains a collection of basic linked list programs implemented in C. Linked lists are fundamental data structures that consist of nodes where each node points to the next node, forming a linear sequence. This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing linked list concepts in the C programming language.

## Programs Included

1. **Singly Linked List Creation:** A program to create a singly linked list with user-defined data values.

2. **Singly Linked List Insertion:** Demonstrates insertion operations such as adding a node at the beginning, at the end, or at a specified position.

3. **Singly Linked List Deletion:** Illustrates deletion operations like removing a node from the beginning, from the end, or a node at a specified position.

4. **Singly Linked List Traversal:** Shows how to traverse and print the elements of a singly linked list.

5. **Singly Linked List Search:** Implements searching for a specific element in the singly linked list.

6. **Doubly Linked List Creation:** A program to create a doubly linked list and establish links between nodes.

7. **Doubly Linked List Insertion:** Covers insertion techniques for a doubly linked list, including insertion at the beginning, end, and a given position.

8. **Doubly Linked List Deletion:** Explores deletion operations in a doubly linked list, including removal from the beginning, end, and a specified position.

9. **Doubly Linked List Traversal:** Demonstrates how to traverse and print elements in a doubly linked list.

10. **Circular Linked List Creation:** A program to create a circular linked list and establish the circular link.

11. **Circular Linked List Insertion:** Focuses on insertion methods in a circular linked list, such as adding a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.

12. **Circular Linked List Deletion:** Covers deletion operations in a circular linked list, including removing a node from the beginning, end, or a specified position.

13. **Circular Linked List Traversal:** Illustrates how to traverse and print elements in a circular linked list.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to compile and run the programs on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/linked-list-programs-c.git`.

2. Navigate to the program you want to run, e.g., `cd singly-linked-list-creation`.

3. Compile the C file using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc program.c -o program`.

4. Run the compiled executable, e.g., `./program`.
